The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for
time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not 
only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had 
any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a 
Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. 
This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself 
doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the 
neighbours" respect, but he gained—well, you will see whether he 
gained anything in the end.
The mother of our particular hobbit — what is a hobbit? I 
suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have 
become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or 
were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the 
bearded dwarves. Hobbits have no beards.  As I was saying, the
mother of this hobbit - of Bilbo Baggins, that is - was the famous
Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old 
Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river 
that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other 
families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a 
fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was 
still something not entirely hobbitlike about them, and once in a while
members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They 
discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact 
remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, 
though they were undoubtedly richer.
